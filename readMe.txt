1. GraphQl is a concept, like REST API, for example when you want
  to get data in REST API about a book we use:

  GET domain.com/book/:id 

  and after that if you want to get info about the author of the 
  book we use: 

  GET domain.com/author/:id

  and if you want to get all the books for this author you need 
  to use another request, and in this point we already made to 
  many request, the graphQl is used to address this issue.

2. We can test GraphQl backend with, the tool named GraphiQL
